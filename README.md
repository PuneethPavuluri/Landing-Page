# Landing-Page
This is a basic landing page built using HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates my understanding of HTML
and CSS. A lot of CSS properties are used for better responsiveness (responsive for all screen sizes) along with a
special typewriter effect created using CSS properties keyframes and animation that contains both typing effect
and blink caret.
